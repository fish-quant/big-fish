    """Cluster spots and detect relevant aggregated structures.

    #. If two spots are distant within a specific radius, we consider they are
       related to each other.
    #. A minimum number spots related to each others defines a cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spots : np.ndarray
        Coordinates of the detected spots with shape (nb_spots, 3) or
        (nb_spots, 2).
    voxel_size : int, float, Tuple(int, float) or List(int, float)
        Size of a voxel, in nanometer. One value per spatial dimension (zyx or
        yx dimensions). If it's a scalar, the same value is applied to every
        dimension.
    radius : int
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as
        in the neighborhood of the other. Radius expressed in nanometer.
    nb_min_spots : int
        The number of spots in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as
        a core point (from which a cluster is expanded). This includes the
        point itself.

    Returns
    -------
    clustered_spots : np.ndarray
        Coordinates of the detected spots with shape (nb_spots, 4) or
        (nb_spots, 3). One coordinate per dimension (zyx or yx coordinates)
        plus the index of the cluster assigned to the spot. If no cluster was
        assigned, value is -1.
    clusters : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (nb_clusters, 5) or (nb_clusters, 4). One coordinate
        per dimension for the clusters centroid (zyx or yx coordinates), the
        number of spots detected in the clusters and its index.
