def build_stacks(
    data_map, input_dimension=None, sanity_check=False, return_origin=False
):
    """Generator to build several stacks from recipe-folder pairs.

    To build a stack, a recipe should be linked to a directory including all
    the files needed to build the stack. The content of the recipe allows to
    reorganize the different files stored in the directory in order to build
    a 5-d tensor. If several fields of view (fov) are store in the recipe,
    several tensors are generated.

    The list 'data_map' takes the form:

        [
         (recipe_1, path_input_directory_1),
         (recipe_2, path_input_directory_1),
         (recipe_3, path_input_directory_1),
         (recipe_4, path_input_directory_2),
         ...
        ]

    The recipe dictionary for one field of view takes the form:

        {
         "fov": str or List[str], (optional)
         "z": str or List[str],   (optional)
         "c": str or List[str],   (optional)
         "r": str or List[str],   (optional)
         "ext": str,              (optional)
         "opt": str,              (optional)
         "pattern": str
         }

    - A field of view is defined by a string common to every images belonging
    to the same field of view ("fov").
    - At least every image are in 2-d with x and y dimensions. So we need to
    mention the round-dimension, the channel-dimension and the z-dimension to
    add ("r", "c" and "z"). For these keys, we provide a list of
    strings to identify the images to stack.
    - Extra information to identify the files to stack in the input folder
    can be provided with the file extension "ext" (usually 'tif' or 'tiff') or
    an optional morpheme ("opt").
    - A pattern used to get the filename ("pattern").

    Example 1. Let us assume 3-d images (zyx dimensions) saved as
    "r03c03f01_405.tif", "r03c03f01_488.tif" and "r03c03f01_561.tif". The first
    morpheme "r03c03f01" uniquely identifies a 3-d field of view. The second
    morphemes "405", "488" and "561" identify three different channels we
    want to stack. There is no round in this experiment. We need to return a
    tensor with shape (1, 3, z, y, x). Thus, a valid recipe would be:

        {
         "fov": "r03c03f01",
         "c": ["405", "488", "561"],
         "ext": "tif"
         "pattern": "fov_c.ext"
         }

    Example 2. Let us assume 2-d images (yx dimensions) saved as
    "dapi_1.TIFF", "cy3_1.TIFF", "GFP_1.TIFF", "dapi_2.TIFF", "cy3_2.TIFF" and
    "GFP_2.TIFF". The first morphemes "dapi", "cy3" and "GFP" identify
    channels. The second morphemes "1" and "2" identify two different fields of
    view. There is no round and no z dimension in this experiment. We can
    build two tensors with shape (1, 3, 1, y, x). Thus, a valid recipe would
    be:

        {
         "fov": ["1", "2"],
         "c": ["dapi", "cy3", "GFP"],
         "ext": "TIFF"
         "pattern": "c_fov.ext"
         }

    sanity_check : bool

    return_origin : bool
        Return the input directory and the recipe used to build the stack.

    add a new dimension to the original tensors (e.g. we stack 2-d images with

    a new dimension are not included in the recipe, an empty dimension is
